# 👋🏼 What is `BNB Chain Learning Pathway`?

We made this decentralized application (dApp) to help developers learn about development on Web3 using BNB Chain.

It's a Next.js app that uses React, TypeScript and smart contract languages (mostly Solidity).

We will guide you through using the various blockchain JavaScript SDKs to interact with the BNB Chain network.

# 🧑‍💻 Get started

## 🤖 Using Gitpod (Recommended)

The best way to go through those courses is using [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io). Gitpod provides prebuilt developer environments in your browser, powered by VS Code. Just sign in using GitHub and you'll be up and running in seconds without having to do any manual setup 🔥

[**Open this repo on Gitpod**](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/RumeelHussainbnb/BNBChainLearningPathway)

## 🐑 Clone locally

Make sure you have installed [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Please install **v14.17.0**, we recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

Then clone the repo, install dependencies and start the server by running all these commands:
